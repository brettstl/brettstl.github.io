		<h1>Data Exploration Notes</h1>
<p>
According to Stephen Few, data analysis is modeling data so you can make sense of it.

</p>
<p>
There are two main methodologies or techniques used to retrieve relevant data from large, unorganized pools. They are the manual and automatic methods. </p>
<p>The manual method is another name for data exploration, while the automatic method is also known as data mining.<p>
<blockquote>
Some people believe these terms are synonymous, while others see a technical difference between them. Data mining generally refers to gathering relevant data from large databases. Data exploration, on the other hand, generally refers to a data user being able to find his or her way through large amounts of data in order to gather necessary information. - https://www.techopedia.com/definition/28789/data-exploration

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<h3>Steps for data exploration</h3>
<ol>
<li> Prepare data for exploration (ideally in a long format)</li>
<li> Identify predictor and target variables</li>
<li> Document assumptions you have about the data</li>
<li> Document methods of collecting and cleaning the data</li>
<li> Review data looking for trends, patterns, and exceptions to these trends and patterns</li>
<li> Use univariate and bi-variate analysis techniques to explore the data</li>
<li> Document interesting information you want to explore in detail</li>
</ol>
<p>
Date exploration happens after you collected and clean your data. It is best if you can clean the data as much as possible before you jump into exploration. 
</p><p>
Data exploration, cleaning and preparation can take up to 70% of your total project time.
</p>
<h3>Cleaning your data</h3>
<p>
You can use some different tools including Excel, Data Wrangler, Trifacta, and Open Refine to clean your data. 

Some common outputs of data needed for exploration:
</p>

<h2>
Variable Identification </h2>
<p>
First, identify Predictor (Input) and Target (output) variables. Next, identify the data type and category of the variables. 

Example: Audience dimensions as predictors of phone calls
</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Type of Variables</th>			<th>Variable</th>					<th>Data Type</th>
	</tr>			
<tr><td>Target							<td>Unique Phone Call Event</td>		<td>Ordinal (dichotomous yes/no)</td></tr>	 
<tr><td>Predictor</td>					<td>gender</td>							<td>Ordinal</td></tr>				 
<tr><td>Predictor</td>					<td>new/return user type</td>			<td>Ordinal</td></tr>					 
<tr><td>Predictor</td>					<td>Region (U.S. State</td>				<td>Nominal</td></tr> 						
<tr><td>Predictor</td>					<td>Device Type (mobile, etc)</td>		<td>Nominal</td></tr>
<tr><td>Predictor</td>					<td>Number of sessions</td>				<td>Ratio</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Univariate Analysis</h3>
<p>
Here we compare the variables one-by-one. The methods to perform uni-variate analysis will depend on whether the variable type is categorical or continuos. 

Univariate analysis can also help identify missing and outlier values. 

<strong>Continuous variables</strong> : You can focus on the central tendencies and spread of the data. 
<strong>Central tendencies to look at</strong>: mean, median, mode.
<strong>Measure of dispersion</strong>: min, max, range, quartile, IQR, variance, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis 
<strong>Visualization methods</strong> : histogram, box plot

Categorical Variables:  The primary way to get an understanding of this data is to use a frequency table to understand distribution fo each category. We can look at both the count and count % against each category. 
Central tendencies to look at: mode
Visualization methods: Bar Charts, stem and leaf, frequency table
</p>
<h3>Bi-Variate Analysis</h3>
<p>
Bi-variate is about finding a relationship between two variables. How you analyze the data is based on the two data types.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Continuous and Continuous</strong>: The best visualization is a scatter plot and it is great way to see negative, positive, curvilinear relationships (as well no relationships)
Correlation: calculate the R score to get an idea of the relationships
</p>
<p>
<strong>Categorical and Categorical</strong>: A two way table allows you to analyze the data and can be used to create a chi-square test.
<strong>Visualization methods</strong>: a stacked column is like a visual version of a two-way table. You can do both count based stacked columns or rate columns where they are all 100%.
</p><p>
<strong>Categorical and Continuous</strong>: To look at the statistical significance we can perform Z-test, T-test or ANOVA.
Visualization methods:  Box plot for each category. 
</p>
<h2>Tools</h2>

<h3>iNZight lite</h3>
<p>
Allows you to view univariate and by-variate date easily, and it can segment data into side-by-size graphs (small multiples) to easily see each segment individually. Great for exploring data. 
</p><p>
This Small multiples time-series example shows how life expectancy is dropping in most N. American nations, and can be used to further explore the nations with the biggest declines like Jamaica and Nicaragua.
